External specification documents for various technologies related to streaming media

RULES & GUIDELINES

1. You may only upload documents which are freely available for download, or have been purchased by Discovery employees for Discovery, or have been acquired as part of Discovery's membership in an organization. (In other words: Don't upload ISO specs that you downloaded from some shady corner of the dark web.)


2. Please upload industry standards specifications to the folder matching the organization which published them (e.g. specs published by SMPTE go in the SMPTE folder, even if they concern topics outside of SMPTE).


3. If you find more recent version of a specification document than the one available here, please upload it. If the new version supercedes the previous versions you may delete the previous versions of the document.


4. Please use the following naming convention for the documents:


[organization] [official document ID] - [document title or brief description] (version number or year-month published)

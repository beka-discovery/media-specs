Consumer Technology Association (CTA) was formerly known as Consumer Electronics Association (CEA), which used to be part of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA).

Older digital TV standards, such as closed captions for DTV, are now governed by CTA but still informally known under their old CEA or EIA prefixes (e.g. EIA-608, CEA-708).

Latest versions of CTA specifications can be found at https://www.cta.tech/Research-Standards/Standards.aspx.

Many are free of charge, but they require a user account to access.
